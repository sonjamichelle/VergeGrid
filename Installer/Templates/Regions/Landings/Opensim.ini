;; Opensim.Proto ROBUST VERSION
;; This is the main configuration file for OpenSimulator.
;; If it's named OpenSim.ini then it will be loaded by OpenSimulator.
;; If it's named OpenSim.ini.example then you will need to copy it to
;; OpenSim.ini first (if that file does not already exist)
;;
;; If you are copying, then once you have copied OpenSim.ini.example to
;; OpenSim.ini you will need to pick an architecture in the [Architecture]
;; section at the end of this file.
;; section at the end of this file.
;;
;; The settings in this file are in the form "<key> = <value>".  For example,
;; save_crashes = false in the [Startup] section below.
;;
;; All settings are initially commented out and the default value used, as
;; found in OpenSimDefaults.ini.  To change a setting, first uncomment it by
;; deleting the initial semicolon (;) and then change the value.  This will
;; override the value in OpenSimDefaults.ini
;;
;; If you want to find out what configuration OpenSimulator has finished with
;; once all the configuration files are loaded then type "config show" on the
;; region console command line.
;;
;;
;; NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS REGARDING THE FORMAT OF THIS FILE
;;
;; All leading white space is ignored, but preserved.
;;
;; Double semicolons denote a text comment
;;
;; ;# denotes a configuration directive description
;;    formatted as:
;;    {option} {depends on} {question to ask} {choices} default value
;;    Any text comments following the declaration, up to the next blank line.
;;    will be copied to the generated file (NOTE: generation is not yet
;;   implemented)
;;
;;    A * in the choices list will allow an empty entry.
;;    An empty question will set the default if the dependencies are
;;    satisfied.
;;
;; ;  denotes a commented out option.
;;    Any options added to OpenSim.ini.example should be initially commented

[Textures]

; If true, textures generated dynamically (i.e. through osSetDynamicTextureData() and similar OSSL functions) are reused where possible
; Chiefly, reuse occurs if a texture has already been generated with identical data and settings, and that texture contains no dynamic components
; (e.g. images pulled from an external HTTP address).
; Reusing previously generated textures results in a much faster update on the viewer but may cause issues if the viewer didn't receive all resolutions of the texture.
; Currently, it will also increase asset cache use since temporary dynamic textures are no longer deleted.
; Hence, currently considered experimental.
; Default is false.
ReuseDynamicTextures=true

; If true, then textures generated dynamically that have a low data size relative to their pixel size are not reused
; This is to workaround an apparent LL 3.3.4 and earlier viewer bug where such textures are not redisplayed properly when pulled from the viewer cache.
; Only set this to true if you are sure that all the viewers using your simulator will not suffer from this problem.
; This setting only has an affect if ReuseDynamicTextures = true
